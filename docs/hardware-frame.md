As a quick start point you can print the official u360gts [3D printed frame](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3203850) of the project.

It is still a work in progress because it is being continuously improved, but it is completely functional.

All information regarding parts, components, and how to assemble it will be found in the summary of the design.
