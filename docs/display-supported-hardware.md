## Supported OLED display devices

The supported OLED displays now include the **SSD1306** and **SH1106** models, as well as the **UG-2864HSWEG01**.

### SSD1306 OLED Display

The SSD1306 OLED display is a 128x64 OLED screen that is visible in bright sunlight, compact, and consumes very little power, making it ideal for use in our antenna tracker.

Please choose your OLED display carefully before purchasing, as some models, while incorporating the SSD1306, may require additional modifications.

Here are several models in two different sizes that have been tested by our community users:

- [I2c 2.42" 128x64 Graphic OLED Yellow Display (Arduino / Pic / multi-wii)](http://www.ebay.es/itm/201468080188?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT)

### SH1106 OLED Display

The SH1106 OLED display is also supported and provides similar functionality to the SSD1306. The main difference is in the driver IC used; some SH1106 displays may offer slightly different connectivity and compatibility settings. Ensure the SH1106 module is compatible with the antenna trackerâ€™s requirements.

Sample SH1106 model:
