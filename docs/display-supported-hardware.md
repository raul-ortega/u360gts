## Supported OLED display devices

The only supported OLED displays are the SSD1306 and UG-2864HSWEG01 models.

### SSD1306 OLED Display

The SSD1306 OLED display is a 128x64 OLED screen that is visible in bright sunlight, compact, and consumes very little power, making it ideal for use in our antenna tracker.

You should choose your OLED display carefully before purchasing it because, although some models incorporate the SSD1306, they may require additional modifications.

Here are several models in two different sizes that have been tested by our community users:
